Change log for Cardinal Spline JS
---------------------------------

2.3.7
BUMP: Bumping version for bower.

2.3.6
ADD: Support empty point array as input (issue #5). Returns empty Float32Array.

2.3.5
ADD: Documentation only (# of points required). Patch touched for bower (new tag).

2.3.4
ADD: Node.js support for curve_func.js (added by @asmuelle)

2.3.3
ADD: Node.js support for curve_calc.js
IMP: Minor speed improvement
FIX: Docs stated default segments value was 20, corrected to 25.

2.3.1
FIX: Made the extension more "bullet-proof" in case other extensions should happen to have the same name.
FIX: JSDoc return type fixed (Array -> Float32Array).
FIX: Minor touch-ups/improvements
ADD: Added two new file versions of the implementation - one pure function if you don't feel comfortable using
extensions, as well as a pure mathematical function to return a point
array for the spline without drawing anything (canvas not required with this version).

2.3
CHG: Using typed arrays also for resulting array (Float32)
CHG: Default segment value is now 25 instead of 20 (dynamic approach is being considered).
IMP: Speed improvements
FIX: Fixed double point entries in result array

2.2
IMP: Using typed arrays internally for cached tension values for speed improvement
REM: A left over and unnecessary console.log removed

2.1.1
FIX: When closed, length of close array was still reflecting total length internally resulting in empty entries
as the closed section is calculated separately.

2.1
ADD: New option: closed loop
FIX: End point wasn't properly considered

2.0
ADD: Optimized inner loop with a caching step
CHG: Removed redundant code
CHG: Cleaned up var declarations
CHG: Removed internal moveTo() to conform better to context behavior in general
